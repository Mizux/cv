Computer Vision & System Software Engineer:
. Strong CMake/C++ Background.
. Development of native CMake/C++/Qt Application.
. Development of Linux Kernel Camera Driver (MT9M114, OV5640).

I'm currently living at Tours (France), and working for SoftBank Robotics Europe
(Paris). I'm maily focus on the support of image pipeline from
the image sensor (i.e. linux driver support and integration) to our middleware
NAOqi (i.e. Video Manager Service) on our humanoid robots.

Before working for SoftBank Robotics Europe and Vi TECHNOLOGY, I have benefited of the elite
program of the higher education system in France (Grandes Écoles) where I gained
knowledge in field of Computer Science. I hold an Engineering Diploma (M. Eng.) from ENSEIRB (Bordeaux, France) which is a Graduate School of Engineering in Electronics, Computer Science and Communication Technologies.

I have mostly carried out research and development engineering projects
(managing team on occasions) for Automated Optical Inspection System and Humanoid Robots.
I have acquired over the years a wide range of skills, be it in Application
Software (Qt, C++), high performance computing (CUDA, C++)
or in driver development for Linux Embedded System (Linux Kernel, C).
Besides engineering, I am currently interested in the management of
projects and technical expertise, especially because I wish to be able to use my knowledge and share it.
I would definitely appreciate going abroad from time to time through my job.
